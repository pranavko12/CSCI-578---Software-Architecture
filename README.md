# CSCI-578 -- Software-Architecture

## Course Outline:
Software architecture has become a central area of study in software engineering in the last few decades.
At the heart of every well-engineered software system is its architecture. Software architecture deals with the key design decisions underlying a software system, reflected in the systemâ€™s high-level building blocks. These building blocks include the components (units of computation in a system), the connectors (models of the interactions between software components), and the configurations (arrangements of software components and connectors, and the rules that guide their composition). Software architectures that are found particularly useful for families of systems are often codified into architectural patterns and styles.

This course will afford the students a comprehensive treatment of software architecture, its foundation,
principles, and elements, including those described above. The class is centered around reading
assignments. The readings are complemented by homework assignments and a course project, in which the
students will be required to apply the course material. In order to successfully master the required content,
students are expected to attend class regularly and participate (as directed) in class discussions.
